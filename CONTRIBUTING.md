* Contribute to Code:  If you want to write fix for a bug, extend exisiting control etc, you can contribute to our code refer [Contribute To Code]() to know more about contribution guidelines. 


### Asking Questions

Do you have any query regarding the tool or existing code? It is recommended that first you go through our [FAQs](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/tree/master/FAQs) and [Issues](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit/issues) to check if the question you have already exists there. If not you can create an issue.
 Your well-framed question can serve as a useful guide to others searching for help.

### Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in DevOps Kit or do you have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

#### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [issues](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been created.
Be sure to scan through the [most popular]() feature requests.
If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and mention if something is still missing there.

#### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

 Try giving appropriate title to the issue for others facing similar issue to identify it. File a single issue per problem and a feature request. Do not add multiple bugs under same issue as the bugs may look similar but their root cause might be different.

#### Best Practices
	• Always try to specify for which version you faced the issue
	• Steps to reproduce the issue
	• Specify the ideal behavior which according to you that should have been there
	• Code snippet, specially the command you ran, the parameters you provided 

#### Contributing Fixes

If you are interested in writing code to fix issues, or contribute to the tool
please see [Contribution Guidelines]() to understand more about where and how we expect your contribution.

#### Submitting Changes
You can find all the pull request raised in the Pull Request Section. If you want submit your changes or bug fixes you would have to create a pull request for the same. Follow the below steps while creating a pull request for reviewers to understand your request.
	* Make sure that you are pointing towards the right fork and branch where your changes were made.
	* Point to <> branch such that your changes are merged into that after your pull request is accepted. If you point to any other branch  than <>, your pull request might not be considered.
	* The pull request template is placed with the intent to be followed while creating a pull request and if you delete or ignore the template, your pull request might not be considered.
	* The SLA for the pull request depends upon various criteria. For more details on SLA you can refer SLA and issue tracking
	
There might be chance that your pull request is not getting accepted, the most basic acceptance criteria are.
	*  The code changes should not impacts performance in negative way, it should perform well in both real and perceived performance.
	*  The code changes should not break existing code flow.
	*  The team and/or feature owner needs to agree with any architectural impact a change may make. Things like new extension APIs must be discussed with and agreed upon by the feature owner.
