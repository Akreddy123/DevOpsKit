Admin users are having high privileged role increases the attack surface for the server without being tracked. Using AAD based identity ensures that there is a built-in high level of assurance in the user identity established for subsequent access control.",

        "MethodName": "CheckResourceAccess",
        "Rationale": "Using a 'user' account should be avoided because, in general, a user account will likely have broader set of privileges to enterprise assets. Using a dedicated SPN ensures that the SPN does not have permissions beyond the ones specifically granted for the given scenario.",
